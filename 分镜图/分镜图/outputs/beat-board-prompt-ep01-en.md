# Beat Board 9-Panel Prompt · ep01

Generate a 3×3 grid of cinematic storyboard keyframe images. **Style requirement: photorealistic live-action, cinematic photography; no anime, animation, 2D cartoon, or illustrated style.** Each cell is one story beat; the 9 cells form a coherent narrative sequence. All cells must share consistent style, character appearance, and lighting. Aspect ratio 9:16 (portrait). Follow the specifications below.

## Story Overview

- High above the clouds, an obsidian execution platform floats over a sea of clouds; enslaved masses kneel; the sky splits and a golden giant eye opens.
- A golden-armored enforcer announces that the Celestial Emperor inspects the realm and today three thousand mortal souls are needed to forge the “Ten Thousand Spirits Blood Pearl”; a cold red beam sweeps the crowd and locks onto the girl Ling’er, who is held suspended in a spread-eagle pose.
- Lin Jin bursts to his feet and charges toward Ling’er; the enforcer casually strikes; Lin Jin’s legs are shattered and he is driven into the ground.
- Ling’er mouths “Survive”; the giant eye blinks; Ling’er shatters into pink crystalline particles and is drawn into the eye; a rusted broken sword falls.
- Lin Jin lies in a pool of blood, his hand inching toward the sword hilt.

## Character Reference

- **Ling'er (Ref. Image 1)**: Use **Reference Image 1** as the character sheet. Face, hair, and body type must match the reference; in this scene (Execution Platform) costume is grey enslaved robe and rusted broken sword.
- **Lin Jin**: Use **Reference Image 2** as the character sheet. Face, hair, and body type must match the reference; in this scene (Execution Platform) costume is grey enslaved robe, state is grime/blood and disheveled long hair with dust and blood.

When generating, use Reference Image 1 and Reference Image 2 as character reference images so Ling'er and Lin Jin match in face, features, hair, and build; only costume and state change per script (grey robe, blood, etc.) in this scene.

## Character Consistency

- **Lin Jin (Ref. Image 2)**: Male, young adult; sharp features, pale complexion, amber/pale gold eyes, strong jaw, high cheekbones, straight nose, full neutral lips; long silver-white hair, center-parted, smooth over shoulders and back; slender, graceful build. This scene: grey enslaved robe, tattered and blood-stained; face streaked with grime and blood, long hair disheveled with dust and blood; arc from terror → roaring charge → crushed and clawing the ground → lying in blood with vacant eyes.
- **Ling’er (Ref. Image 1)**: Female, teenage; oval face, fair skin, small red stylized mark (bird/abstract) on forehead between brows, large brown eyes with long lashes, thin dark brows, small delicate nose, full lips natural light pink; long dark black hair, front sections pulled back, crown updo with silver/crystal hairpins and pearl chains, rest flowing over shoulders and back; slender, ethereal. This scene: grey enslaved robe, rusted broken sword; arc from agony while suspended → mouthing “Survive” → shattering into light; hair drifting during suspension and shattering.
- **Golden-armored Enforcer**: Male, three meters tall, mechanical and cold; full golden armor, expressionless, hovering mid-air; no emotional arc (always cold); golden armor reflects cold light, no skin visible; helmet obscures face.
- **Enslaved Masses (crowd)**: Over thirty thousand; uniform grey robes, kneeling or scattering in fear; no individual close-ups, emphasize scale and unified costume.

Critical: Lin Jin and Ling’er must match **Reference Image 1 and Reference Image 2** in face, features, hair, and build across all cells; this scene only costume (grey robe) and state (blood, disheveled) change per script; enforcer design consistent; crowd costume unified.

## Visual Guidelines

- **Overall style**: **Photorealistic live-action**, cinematic, real-camera film look; **no anime, animation, 2D, manga, manhwa, cartoon, illustration, or hand-drawn style.** Short-form vertical; lens language leans epic and oppressive, balancing massive scale with character emotion. Skin, fabric, metal, and environment must read as real-world physics, like shot film.
- **Color and light**: Cool dominant palette—obsidian black, cold gold for chains and eye, red beam and blood pools for contrast; cold noon light through cloud gaps; cold golden rim light on the eye and enforcer; blood and Ling’er’s particle glow as warm accents for cruelty and beauty. Lighting follows real photography logic, not anime highlights or outlines.
- **Materials**: Obsidian floor rough and reflective; chains and golden armor hard metal; crowd robes coarse grey; rusted broken sword. All surfaces read as real photography, not cartoon/anime rendering.
- **Lens language**: Establishing shots in extreme wide / wide for scale; emotion and action in medium / medium-close; aftermath in medium-close and hand close-up; portrait framing respects vertical layers and sky–ground relationship.

## Constraints

- **Style prohibition**: No anime, animation, 2D, manga, manhwa, cartoon, illustration, hand-drawn, or cel-shaded style; must read as **cinematic live-action photography**.
- Aspect ratio fixed at 9:16 (portrait); all cells use portrait framing.
- Supernatural elements (golden eye, enforcer, red beam) must have believable light and texture within a photorealistic frame, like live-action VFX; avoid cartoon or anime look.

## 9-Panel Layout

Row 1: Cells 1–3 (world / eye / enforcer)  
Row 2: Cells 4–6 (Ling’er selected / Lin Jin charges / Lin Jin crushed)  
Row 3: Cells 7–9 (last words / Ling’er shatters / aftermath)

Narrative continuity, emotional progression.

## Panel Breakdown (9 Keyframes)

**Style prefix when generating (apply to every cell)**: Photorealistic live-action, cinematic photography; no anime / animation / 2D / cartoon style.

### 1 (Row 1, left) — 【Execution Platform】

Photorealistic live-action, extreme wide shot, high above the earth. A vast obsidian platform floats over a sea of clouds; four massive golden chains descend from the sky and lock the platform at its corners. Crowds of figures in grey robes kneel like ants. Cold noon light breaks through the clouds; the obsidian surface catches hard reflections; clouds churn below.  
Focus: scale of the structure, mass of obsidian and chains, size of the crowd and oppressive ritual.

### 2 (Row 1, center) — 【The Eye Opens】

Photorealistic live-action, low-angle wide. The sky tears open without warning. A colossal golden eye opens slowly behind the clouds, its pupil cold as it looks down at the platform. The clouds are edged with cold golden light from the eye; light pours from the rift.  
Focus: scale and menace of the eye, the rift, the ominous sense of divine judgment from above.

### 3 (Row 1, right) — 【Enforcer Announces】

Photorealistic live-action, medium wide. A three-meter-tall golden-armored enforcer hovers above the platform, expressionless; his armor catches cold light. Below, the kneeling crowd and obsidian ground. The moment he announces the Celestial Emperor’s inspection and the need for three thousand souls for the Blood Pearl—authoritative and cold.  
Focus: enforcer’s size and hover, authority and indifference.

### 4 (Row 2, left) — 【Ling’er Selected】

Photorealistic live-action, medium shot. A cold red beam descends from the sky, sweeps the crowd, then fixes on the girl Ling’er. She is held by invisible force, suspended in mid-air, limbs pulled into a spread-eagle; her grey robe drifts; her expression is one of extreme pain. The crowd still kneels; figures visible in the back.  
Focus: red light on Ling’er, suspended pose and helplessness, pain.

### 5 (Row 2, center) — 【Lin Jin Charges】

Photorealistic live-action, medium shot. Lin Jin explodes from his knees, face filthy with terror and resolve, roaring “Ling’er!” as he lunges toward her in the air, grey robe flying. The crowd scatters in fear, clearing a path.  
Focus: Lin Jin’s burst of motion, roaring expression, resolve and tension.

### 6 (Row 2, right) — 【Lin Jin Crushed】

Photorealistic live-action, medium-close. The instant a golden strike hits like a hammer. Lin Jin’s legs twist; his body is driven into a crack in the obsidian floor; blood sprays and stains the ground; he convulses, hands clawing the stone, eyes bloodshot.  
Focus: the moment of crushing, physical cost, blood and fissure, despair and powerlessness.

### 7 (Row 3, left) — 【Survive】

Photorealistic live-action, medium shot, dual focus. Above: Ling’er suspended, in extreme pain, turning with difficulty toward the ground, mouthing “Survive” without sound. Below: Lin Jin convulsing, clawing the ground, eyes bloodshot, roaring “Let her go.” Their gazes meet in despair.  
Focus: Ling’er’s mouthing “Survive” and Lin Jin’s desperate roar, emotional peak and last words.

### 8 (Row 3, center) — 【Ling’er Shatters】

Photorealistic live-action, medium wide. The moment the golden eye blinks. Ling’er’s body shatters instantly; she does not bleed but becomes countless pink crystalline particles, beautiful and cruel, drawn upward into the eye. Only a rusted broken sword falls helplessly from the air. Lin Jin’s prone silhouette visible below.  
Focus: particle effect of shattering, falling sword, contrast of beauty and cruelty.

### 9 (Row 3, right) — 【Aftermath】

Photorealistic live-action, medium-close. Lin Jin lies in a pool of blood, pupils unfocused, face against the obsidian. A bloody hand twitches and inches, stiffly, toward the rusted broken sword planted beside him. The golden enforcer has vanished in light; the platform is silent; cold light falls on hand and hilt.  
Focus: distance between hand and hilt, stillness after the storm, seed of revenge.
